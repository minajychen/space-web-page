# Space

**10 points**

## Requirements

Use your creativity to build a page about space!

* Could an asteroid hit the Earth this month?
* When's the next solar flare?
* When is the next SpaceX launch?
* What does the Mars landscape look like?
* What city is directly under the International Space Station this very minute?
* What are the names of all of the people in space right?
* What's a cool astronomy photo that could be used as (say) the background of the entire page?

You don't have to display the answers to these exact questions.  I'm just
trying to inspire your curiosity!

Try to build a simple "mission control" dashboard for a few interesting facts about space.

Here are some APIs you can use to help provide data for your page:

1. https://api.nasa.gov
   - Get your own API key (free, takes about 10 seconds)
   - Browse the available APIs
   - Beware rate limitations
   - I especially recommend APOD, Asteroid NeoWs, and DONKI services
2. http://open-notify.org
3. https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API

and there's even more in the internet.

Your page should be implemented in `index.html` but feel free to add other CSS files, JS files, or even turn it into a React application if you want.  However, plain vanilla HTML/CSS/JS is all that's required.

**IMPORTANT** If you use an API that provides data for a specific date range, always use the date range `2022-12-01` thru `2022-12-08`, so that we're both looking at the same version of your page.

## Grading Rubric

Much of the grading of this assignment is subjective, which is a bit
different than our other assignments. 

* Up to 2 points for each space-specific item on your page (up to 8 pts total) based on a nice display of space information or graphics
* Up to 2 points for overall design aesthetic/creativity

You're encouraged to come up with a colorful, creative approach... or a scientific, Star Trek-style display... or anything else you prefer, but it should be something more than just plain headings and paragraphs.

Happy coding!
